  @file GestureRecognize_HighRate.ino
  @brief Present the 9 built-in gestures data the sensor supports. 
  @n Wave your hand above the sensor (within 0~20cm), it can recognize 9 kinds of gestures: move up, down, left, right, forward,
  @n backward, clockwise, anti-clockwise, wave.
  @n For more usages of the sensor, refer to the description about setGestureHighRate in function setup.

'''Set to fast detection mode 
 # If the parameter is set to false, the module enters slow detection mode, and it detects one gesture every 2s. We have integrated
 # some gestures inside the module to make it convenient for beginners.   
 # The slow mode can recognize 9  basic gestures and 4 expanded gestures: move left, right, up, down, forward, backward, clockwise,
 # counter-clockwise, wave. slowly move left and right, slowly move up and down, slowly move forward and backward, wave slowly and 
 # randomly.
 #
 # If the parameter is set to true, the module enters fast detection mode. 
 # The fast mode can recognize 9 gestures: move left, right, up, down, forward, backward, clockwise, counter-clockwise, wave
 # To detect the combination of these gestures, like wave left, right and left quickly, users needs to design their own algorithms logic.
 # Since users only use limited gestures in this mode, we are not going to integrate too much expanded gestures in the library.
 # If necessary, you can complete the algorithm logic in the ino file by yourself.
